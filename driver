/* Class: CMSC203 CRN 46519
 Program: Assignment #2
 Instructor: Farnaz Eivazi
 Summary of Description: Build an application that will receive a guess and report if your 
guess is the random number that was generated.  Your application will narrow down the choices
 according to your previous guesses and continue to prompt you to enter a guess until you 
 guess correctly.  
 Due Date: 06/30 /2022 
 * Platform/compiler:Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
   I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
   I have not given my code to any student.
   Print your Name here: Bryan Orozco
